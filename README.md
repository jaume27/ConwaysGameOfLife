# ConwaysGameOfLife
Conway's game of Life in C++.

## How to execute the code

First you have to compile the code in the terminal (I use g++)
Then you have to execute the file *.x giving them a *.txt with the examples of living cells

```
g++ Conways_GameOfLife.cc -o Conways_GameOfLife.x
./Conways_GameOfLife.x < Examples/1.txt
```
